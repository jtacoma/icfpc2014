ICFP Contest 2014
=================

This ICFP Contest 2014 entry uses the language Go.

The package in src/lambdaman provides an algorithm for transforming a Go
AST into LambdaMan CPU assembly code.  The LambdaMan bot itself is
written in the subset of Go that this algorithm supports.

Building
--------

Ensure the prerequisites are satisified:

 - Golang, and specifically the "go" command line tool, is available.
 - The GOPATH environment variable includes the absolute path of this
   repository.

If `go` is available in PATH and the `pwd` command outputs the current
directory's absolute path then the following invocation should do the
trick:

    GOPATH=`pwd` go run main.go > lambdaman.gcc

Copy the resulting lambdaman.gcc file to a directory named "solution"
alongside the directory containing this file, which should be named
"code", and create a .zip or .tar.gz file containing both.
